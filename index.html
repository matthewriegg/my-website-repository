    <h2>"Come Visit the Pacific Northwest's Second Best City!</h2>
    <p>Seattle is home to the Seahawks, the Mariners, the Kraken, the Microsoft, and the Boeing. But one thing it perhaps not home to is:</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>To provide proper context for why we exist as a company. Just think. Our city has a monopoly on clouds.
        We think it's time to seek other angles of the cityscape and have heard that there is a distant star that
        is reportedly visible from earth, but has continued to elude Seattlites of all ages since recorded NOAA 
        weather reporting began in the early 20th century. We can report that Arizona transplants often confirm
        recalling such an extraterrestrial object, but their memory is usually: "foggy."
    </p>
    
    <p>We are not the typical tourism company. While Portland (admittedly the surperior city by virtue of more
        sun sightings) has long advertised Sasquatch-Bigfoot expeditions, and San Francisco has touted empty
        freeway sighting hunts, Seattle keeps it special, with potential for these activies and some of the most 
        challenging sun finding geography.
